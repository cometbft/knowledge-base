# Messages to Events

The consensus state-machine operates on complex `Event`s that reflect the
reception of one or multiple `Message`s, combined with state elements and the
interaction with other modules.

This document overviews how messages should be handled at different stages of
the protocol.

It is assume that a process is at round `r` of height `h` of consensus, or in
short, at round `(h, r)`.

## Different heights

Messages with heights `h'` with either `h' < h` (past) or `h' > h` (future).

The pseudo-code description of the algorithm ignores messages from different
heights.
If we take the same approach in this specification, we have to specify
separately modules responsible to handle those messages.


- Past heights (`h' < h`): the consensus state machine is not affected by such
  messages. However, their reception might indicate that a peer is lagging
  behind in the protocol, and need to be synchronized.
  - In CometBFT's implementation we handle message from the previous height
    (`h' = h - 1`) for the `LastCommit` vote set. This only happens during the
    first step of the first round (`r = 0`) of a height.
- Future heights (`h' > h`): the consensus state machine is not able to process
  message from future heights in a proper way, as the validator set for them is
  not known. However, once the process reaches this height `h'`, those messages
  are _required_ for proper operation. There are two options here:
  1. Buffer a limited amount of such messages
  2. Assume that the communication subsystem (p2p) is able to retrieve (ask for
     retransmission) of them when the process reaches height `h'`.
     Notice that this option implies that processes keep a minimal set of
     consensus messages that enables peers lagging behind to decide a past height.

## Previous rounds

Messages from rounds `(h, r')` with `r' < r`: same height `h` but previous round `r'`.

The consensus state machine requires receiving and processing messages from
previous rounds:

- `PREVOTE` messages can produce a Proof of Lock (POL) `2f + 1 ⟨PREVOTE, h, vr, id(v)⟩`
  needed for accepting `PROPOSAL(h, r, v, vr)` message from the current round,
  where `vr == r' < r` (L28).
- `PRECOMMIT` messages can produce a Precommit quorum `2f + 1 ⟨PRECOMMIT, h, r', id(v)⟩`
  that leads to the decision of `v` at round `r'` (L49).
- `PROPOSAL` messages can be required to match a produced Precommit quorum (L49).
  - Associated full value messages are required to produce the `⟨PROPOSAL, h, r', v, *⟩` event

The production of the enumerated events from previous rounds should be
identical to the production of events from messages from the [current round](#current-round).

## Future rounds

Messages from rounds `(h, r')` with `r' > r`: same height `h` but future round `r'`.

### Round skipping

The consensus state machine requires receiving and processing messages from
future rounds for enabling the _round skipping_ mechanism, defined as follows
in the pseudo-code:

```
55: upon f + 1 ⟨∗, hp, round, ∗, ∗⟩ with round > roundp do
56:   StartRound(round)
```

The current interpretation of this rule is that messages from a round `r' > r`
are received from `f + 1` voting-power equivalent distinct senders.
This means, that at least `1` correct process is at round `r'`.

While this threshold does not need to be adopted (it can be configurable),
messages from a future round should initially have their unique senders counted.
Once the round skip threshold of processes is reached, the corresponding event
should be produced.

### Limits

The same reasoning applied for messages from [future heights](#different-heights)
applies for messages from future rounds.

Messages from future rounds are _required_ for the proper operation of the
consensus state machine once the process reaches their round `r'`.
There are two options, which can in particular be combined:

1. Buffer a limited amount of such messages, or messages from a limited amount
   of future rounds `r'`
   - In CometBFT's implementation, only messages from round `r' = r + 1` are tracked.
2. Assume that the communication subsystem (p2p) is able to retrieve (ask for
   retransmission) of messages from future rounds when the process reaches round `r'`.
   Since messages from [previous rounds](#previous-rounds) are stored by
   default, peers that have reached the future round `r'` should be able to
   retransmit them.

## Current round

Messages matching the current round `(h, r)` of a process produce most of the
relevant events for the consensus state machine.

TODO:

## Counting votes

Messages `⟨PREVOTE, h, r, *⟩` and `⟨PRECOMMIT, h, r, *⟩` are generically called votes.
They refer to a round step `(h, r, s)` of consensus, where `s` is defined by
the vote type, either `PREVOTE` or `PRECOMMIT`.

The processing of _individual_ vote messages don't produce events relevant for
the consensus state machine.
But when the number of unique vote messages referring to a given round step
`(h, r, s)` reaches a given _threshold_, relevant events are produced;
the produced event depends on the value carried by such votes.

General assumptions regarding vote messages:

- Vote messages are produced, signed and broadcast by a validator, which is its
  *sender*
  - To define whether a vote message for round step `(h, r, s)` is valid, the
    validator set for height `h` must to be known.
    The validator set can change over heights, but it is the same within a height.
- To each validator in the validator set of a height `h` is associated a *voting power*
  - Thresholds are computed from the voting power associated to the
    sender of each vote message
- A vote message carries a value: either a reference to a proposed value
  `id(v)`, or the special `nil` value
  - For practical effects, it should be considered that the size of vote
    messages is constant
- Correct validators produce at most one vote message per round step: either
  for a `id(v)` or for `nil`
- Byzantine validators may equivocate and produce multiple distinct vote
  messages for the same round step. Equivocating vote messages differ on the
  value they carry: for  `nil`, `id(v)`, `id(v')`, etc.
  - This possibility constitutes an attack vector. A process must thus restrict
    the number of distinct vote messages from the same sender and referring to
    the same round step that can be stored.

### `f + 1` threshold

This threshold represents that vote messages referring to a round step were
received from a enough number of unique senders, so that it is guaranteed that
_at least one_ of the senders is a _correct_ validator.

The rationale here is that the cumulative voting power of Byzantine validators
cannot exceed `f`, so that at least one of the considered vote messages must
have been produced by a correct validator.

### `2f + 1` threshold

This threshold represents that vote messages referring to a round step were
received from a enough number of unique senders, so that it is guaranteed that
_the majority_ of the senders are _correct_ validators.

The rationale here is that the cumulative voting power of Byzantine validators
cannot exceed `f`, so that the subset of considered vote messages that must
have been produced by correct validators have a cumulative voting power of at
least `f + 1`, which is strictly greater than `f`.

> TODO: this also means that the majority of the voting power hold by correct
> validators is represented in the considered set of vote messages.
