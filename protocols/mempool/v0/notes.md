### How to generate the SVG file

The diagram in the SVG file was generated with [draw.io][drawio].

There are multiple options: 
- With the desktop application. 
    - Open the `.drawio` file with the app and select in the app's menu `File > Export...`.
    - Or with the app's CLI. For example, in MacOS: 
        `/Applications/draw.io.app/Contents/MacOS/draw.io --export --format svg mempool-v0.drawio`
- With the VS Code extension. Open the `.drawio` file VS Code and select in the extension's menu `File > Export...`.
