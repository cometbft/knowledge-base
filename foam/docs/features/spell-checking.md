# Spell Checking

There are many spell checking extensions for VS Code.

The most popular spell checker for VS Code is [Code Spell Checker](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=streetsidesoftware.code-spell-checker).

Another one of our favorites is [LTeX](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=valentjn.vscode-ltex&ssr=false#overview), which is a bit heavier but offers some extra functionality.

Another popular one is [Spellright](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ban.spellright), but be mindful that there have been reports of incompatibility with the `vscode-markdown` extension (see https://github.com/foambubble/foam/issues/1068).
