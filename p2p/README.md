# Peer-to-Peer Communication

**Important:** The official documentation and specification of the p2p
communication layer is located in the main CometBFT repository:
https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/tree/main/spec/p2p

This repository stores unfinished work, work in progress, and auxiliary
material for the official specification of the p2p layer.

- [Connection Management](./connection-management/): documents the execution
  flows for establishing connections. This is a work in progress tracked by
  https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/601

- [Multiplex Connections](./multiplex-connection/): documents channels and
  multiplex connections. This is a work in progress tracked by
  https://github.com/cometbft/cometbft/issues/600

- [Reactors API](./reactors/): additional informal and topics under discussion
  regarding the Reactor abstraction and the API the p2p layer provides to
  reactors.
